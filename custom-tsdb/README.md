# Kubecost with existing multi-cluster aggregated metrics

Note that the most common support issue with Kubecost is due to misconfigured Prometheus. Kubecost has a turnkey solution for multi-cluster and the below configuration should only be used by advanced Kubernetes teams.

This repo is intended for use during a POC with assistance from the Solutions Engineering team.

It is recommended to run Kubecost with default settings during proof-of-concepts in order to reduce issues.

Before disabling Kubecost prometheus, multi-cluster metric aggregation must be reliable and include per-cluster labels.

 > Multi-cluster requires an enterprise subscription


## Installation

In addition to the settings below, each cluster must scrape the kubecost exporter.

To scrape the Kubecost exporter,  either use Kubecost serviceMonitor (in the yaml config for both primary and secondaries) or see [extraScrapeConfigs.yaml](extraScrapeConfigs.yaml).

Negative idle costs are almost always a result of missing these metrics.

### Primary cluster install:

```sh
helm install kubecost \
  --repo https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/ cost-analyzer \
  --namespace kubecost --create-namespace \
  -f values-primary.yaml
```

### Secondary clusters run a minimal footprint.

```sh
helm install kubecost \
  --repo https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/ cost-analyzer\
  --namespace kubecost --create-namespace \
  -f values-secondary.yaml
```

### Cloud Cost Reconciliation

It is recommended to get Kubecost up and running before configuring cloud-integrations.

Without cloud-integrations, Kubecost will use public onDemand rates for each cloud provider. In order to reconcile the short-term onDemand costs with actual cloud billing, configure the following:

- [AWS cloud-integration](https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/main/aws-out-of-cluster.md)
- [Azure cloud-integration](https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/main/azure-out-of-cluster.md)
- [GCP cloud-integration](https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/main/gcp-out-of-cluster.md)

During a POC, these secrets can be entered in the Kubecost UI in the `Settings` page under `Cloud Cost Settings`.

Long-term, Kubecost recommends storing the configuration in `cloud-integration.json` that is described in the respective folders in this repo.

- [Azure](../azure/)
- [GCP](../gcp/)
