# This is a simple python script written to interact with the kubecost 'model/allocation' API endpoint.  The script will create a file json and jsonl file.
# This script was intended to create jsonl output to be consumed by products like BigQuery which require jsonl
# Please find more information about the 'model/allocation/' endpoint at https://docs.kubecost.com/apis/apis-overview/allocation
