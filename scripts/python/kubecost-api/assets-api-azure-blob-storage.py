# This is a simple python script written to interact with the kubecost 'model/assets' API endpoint.  The script will create a local json output file.
# With the AWS cli configured in your workspace, you have the option to upload the output json file to an AWS S3 bucket.
# Please find more information about the 'model/assets/' endpoint at https://docs.kubecost.com/apis/apis-overview/assets-api
